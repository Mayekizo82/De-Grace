# De-Grace.
All through scripture, we understand that the end of a thing is better than the beginning. For at the end, it shall speak. Whatever you have believed God for from the beginning of the year till now that have not materialise in your life, this month you will receive them cheaply in the name of Jesus.
Great Great Happenings, we will all experience this new month. Amen.
